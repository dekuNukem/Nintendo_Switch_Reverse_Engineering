# My Nintendo Switch reverse engineering attempts

I'm just going to dump all my discoveries here, and hopefully they would be useful to the Nintendo Switch community.

If you think something is wrong, have some observations that I might have missed, stuff you want to contribute, or just general questions please feel free to post here.

If you want to use the information here somewhere else, feel free to do so, but please credit me (dekuNukem) if possible.

## Left Joycon PCB Layout and test points

[Full-size PDF](./joycon_left_pcb.pdf).

The "JC" is for the 10-pin Joycon connector, see below for details.

### Remarks

* Joycon runs at 1.8V

* There is no silkscreen marking component and test point numbers, so maybe Nintendo is trying to discourage people from doing funky things to the Joycon?

* Also, in a bizarre move, Nintendo didn't use the traditional "one side pulled-up and other side to ground" way of reading buttons, instead they used a keypad configuration where buttons are arranged in rows and columns. They used the keypad scanner built-in inside the BCM20734 with 128KHz clock for reading the buttons. That means it would be extremely hard to spoof button presses for TAS and twitch-plays. Maybe the Pro controller is different, need to buy one though.

* The only button that's not part of the keypad is the joystick button, which is still activated by pulling it down to ground.

## Left Joycon SPI flash dump

Well it's not actually a dump, just a capture of the SPI lines when the Joycon is powered up (battery connected). I don't have time to go through it right now but of course you can if you want.

The SPI clock runs at 3MHz.

[Raw capture data](./logic_captures/leftjoyconspiflashpoweron.logicdata).

## Joycon to Console Communication

When attached to the console, the Joycon talks to it through a physical connection instead of Bluetooth. There are 10 pins on the connector, I'm just going to arbitrarily name it like this:

Looking at the pins on the left Joycon, the left most one is Pin 1, and the right most one is Pin 10. I simply removed the rumble motor, burned a hole on the back cover, and routed all the wires out through that.

[And here](./logic_captures/leftjoycon_docking.logicdata) is a capture of the docking of the left Joycon.

* When first connected the baud rate is at 1000000bps(!), after the initial handshake the speed is then switched to 3125000bps(!!). The handshake probably exchanges information about the side of the Joycon, the color, and bluetooth address etc.

### Handshake procedure

* Pin 5 (Serial data, console to Joycon) is normally pulled high on the console side when nothing is connected. Since this line is inverted on the Joycon side, it will be pulled down when a Joycon is attached to the console, thus initializing a handshake.

* It seems Pin 5 needs to be pulled down for more than 500ms for the handshake to take place.

* Handshake starts at 1000000bps, and the console will send a 4-byte start sequence of `A1 A2 A3 A4`, around 46us later followed by 12 byte command of `19 01 03 07 00 A5 02 01 7E 00 00 00`. It will send those commands repeatedly every 100ms (10Hz) for 3 seconds. If no response is received it gives up and wait for another event on the line.

* Under construction...

### Protocol

In normal operation the console asks Joycon for an update every 15ms (66.6fps), the command for requesting update is:


```
19 01 03 08 00 92 00 01 00 00 69 2d 1f
```

Around 4ms later, Joycon respond with a 61 bytes long answer.

One sample:

```
19 81 03 38 
00 92 00 31 
00 00 e9 2e 
30 7f 40 00 
00 00 65 f7 
81 00 00 00 
c0 23 01 e2 
ff 3e 10 0a 
00 d6 ff d0 
ff 23 01 e1 
ff 37 10 0a 
00 d6 ff cf 
ff 29 01 dd 
ff 34 10 0a 
00 d7 ff ce 
ff 
```

The first 8 byte is always ` 19 81 03 38 00 92 00 31 `, I'm not sure if this differs in different Joycons because I have only took apart one.

### Button status

The 16th and 17th byte (on line 5, before `65 f7`) are the button status, when a button is pressed the corresponding bit is set to 1.

### Joystick value

Byte 19 and 20 (`f7 81` between 5th and 6th line) are the Joystick values, most likely the raw 8-bit ADC data. Byte 19 is X while byte 20 is Y. Again, bizarrely, the X value is reversed, as in the `f7` should actually be `7f` (127 at neutral position). The Y value is correct though (`0x81` is 129).

### The rest of them

Still working on decoding those... It has to contain battery level, button status, joystick position, accelerometer and gyroscope data, and maybe more.

## Joycon spoofing

Right now I'm working on spoofing Joycon with a microcontroller, it's basically a replay attack. It's sort of working now but still needs some refinement. I'll do a detailed writeup when it's finished but feel free to take a look at the code (it's a mess).

## Ending remarks

Right now I have only took apart one left Joycon and have yet to tear into the console itself, because I want to finish the Zelda first. But so far it looks like Nintendo has made some really weird design decisions both in software and in hardware, will probably make what I'm doing more difficult. Anyway, I'll update this from time to time when I have new discoveries. Please share if you find this useful.
